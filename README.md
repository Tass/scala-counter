============

A Counter class for Scala

# Install

For sbt, use:

    libraryDependencies += "org.rogach" %% "scallop" % "0.8.1"

or when you prefer the seq approach:

    "org.rogach" %% "scallop" % "0.8.1",

# Use

Read the source or use completion. Should be self-explanitory. `toCounter` exists so you can typecast a `Counter` to another `Numeric` type.

# Thanks
- To tpolecat for the Numeric implicits help.
