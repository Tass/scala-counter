============

A Counter class for Scala

# Install

For sbt, use:

    libraryDependencies += "org.reactormonk" %% "counter" % "1.3.3"

or when you prefer the seq approach:

    "org.reactormonk" %% "counter" % "1.3.3",

# Use

Read the source or use completion. Should be self-explanitory. `toCounter` exists so you can typecast a `Counter` to another `Numeric` type.

# Thanks
- To tpolecat for the Numeric implicits help.
